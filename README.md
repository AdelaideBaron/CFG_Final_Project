  ## API Keys
For both the [UniDB](https://unidbapi.com/API) and the [Open Weather Geocoding](https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api) API you will need to aquire your own keys. 
  
  In the create_password_file.py file, you will need to insert your API keys and run these first. The Jupyter Notebooks then pull the API keys from the file created. The keys are not to be uploaded to github, and must remain local, for security. 
  
  If you run out of calls during the run of the jupyter notebook, please obtain a new API key, update create_password_file.py, and re-run the sells to extract the API key and get endpoint.  
 

  ## uniDB_demographics.ipynb 
  All API work has been completed inside one notebook: uniDB_demographics.ipynb. 
  
  It is split into the following sections:
